        "Sure! Here's a concise list of all the questions with short Python-focused answers:\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  \n",
        "**Ans:** A programming paradigm based on objects which contain data and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **What is a class in OOP**  \n",
        "**Ans:** A blueprint for creating objects; defines attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What is an object in OOP**  \n",
        "**Ans:** An instance of a class with its own data and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation**  \n",
        "**Ans:** Abstraction hides complexity; encapsulation hides data using access control.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **What are dunder methods in Python**  \n",
        "**Ans:** Special methods with double underscores (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`) used to define behavior for built-in operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP**  \n",
        "**Ans:** A class can inherit properties and methods from another class.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **What is polymorphism in OOP**  \n",
        "**Ans:** The ability to use a common interface for different data types or classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **How is encapsulation achieved in Python**  \n",
        "**Ans:** Using private (`_`, `__`) variables and methods to restrict access.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **What is a constructor in Python**  \n",
        "**Ans:** The `__init__` method, used to initialize object attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **What are class and static methods in Python**  \n",
        "**Ans:**  \n",
        "- `@classmethod`: accesses the class (`cls`) not instance.  \n",
        "- `@staticmethod`: doesn’t access class or instance, works like a regular function in a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **What is method overloading in Python**  \n",
        "**Ans:** Python doesn’t support traditional overloading; can use default arguments or `*args`.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **What is method overriding in OOP**  \n",
        "**Ans:** A subclass provides a new version of a method inherited from the parent.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **What is a property decorator in Python**  \n",
        "**Ans:** `@property` lets you access a method like an attribute (e.g., `obj.name` instead of `obj.get_name()`).\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **Why is polymorphism important in OOP**  \n",
        "**Ans:** It allows flexibility and reusable code by using shared interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **What is an abstract class in Python**  \n",
        "**Ans:** A class with abstract methods (defined using `abc` module) that must be implemented in subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **What are the advantages of OOP**  \n",
        "**Ans:** Reusability, scalability, modularity, and easier maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. **What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable**  \n",
        "**Ans:**  \n",
        "- Class variable: shared by all instances.  \n",
        "- Instance variable: unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. **What is multiple inheritance in Python**  \n",
        "**Ans:** A class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. **Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python**  \n",
        "**Ans:**  \n",
        "- `__str__`: human-readable string.  \n",
        "- `__repr__`: official string representation (for debugging).\n",
        "\n",
        "20. **What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python**  \n",
        "**Ans:** Calls a method from the parent class, useful in inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. **What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python**  \n",
        "**Ans:** Called when an object is deleted to handle cleanup tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. **What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python**  \n",
        "**Ans:**  \n",
        "- `@staticmethod`: no access to instance or class.  \n",
        "- `@classmethod`: access to class (`cls`), not instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. **How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance**  \n",
        "**Ans:** Subclasses override methods; the same method name behaves differently based on the object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. **What is method chaining in Python OOP**  \n",
        "**Ans:** Calling multiple methods on the same object in one line by returning `self` from methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. **What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python**  \n",
        "**Ans:** Makes an object callable like a function using `obj()` syntax.\n",
