        "\n",
        "Interpreted languages (like Python) are executed line-by-line by an interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compiled languages (like C++) are converted into machine code by a compiler before execution, which usually makes them faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "Exception handling allows a program to respond to runtime errors using try, except, finally, and else blocks, preventing crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "The finally block runs no matter what, whether an exception is raised or not. It's used for cleanup tasks like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "Logging is a way to record messages that describe events in your program. It helps in debugging and monitoring your applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "The __del__ method is a destructor called when an object is about to be destroyed. It's used for cleanup operations.\n",

        "\n",
        "9. Difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Multithreading uses multiple threads within the same process (shared memory).\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing uses separate processes (separate memory), better for CPU-bound tasks.\n",

        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection work?\n",
        "Python tracks object references and uses reference counting. If an object's reference count drops to zero, it is collected. It also handles cyclic references using the gc module.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. Purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "The else block runs only if no exception occurs in the try block. It's used for code that should run only if everything goes well.\n",
