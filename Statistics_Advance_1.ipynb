        "*1. What is a random variable in probability theory?**\n",
        "A random variable is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon. It assigns a real number to each outcome in a sample space.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. What are the types of random variables?**\n",
        "There are two main types:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Discrete random variables**: Take on a countable number of values.\n",
        "* **Continuous random variables**: Take on an infinite number of values within a range.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Discrete distributions** describe random variables that take specific, separate values (e.g., number of heads in coin tosses).\n",
        "* **Continuous distributions** describe variables that can take any value in a range (e.g., height, weight).\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?**\n",
        "For **continuous variables**, the **PDF** describes the likelihood of the variable taking on a range of values. It’s a function where the area under the curve between two values gives the probability of the variable falling in that interval.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from probability distribution functions (PDF)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **PDF** shows the probability *density*.\n",
        "* **CDF** shows the cumulative probability that a variable is less than or equal to a certain value. It’s the integral (area) of the PDF up to that point.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. What is a discrete uniform distribution?**\n",
        "A distribution where all possible outcomes are equally likely. Example: Rolling a fair die (each number from 1 to 6 has a probability of 1/6).\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Only two outcomes: success (1) and failure (0).\n",
        "* A single trial with probability **p** of success and **1 - p** of failure.\n",
        "* Mean = **p**, Variance = **p(1 - p)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**8. What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?**\n",
        "The binomial distribution models the number of successes in **n** independent Bernoulli trials with success probability **p**.\n",
        "Used for scenarios like “how many heads in 10 coin tosses.”\n",
        "\n",
        "**9. What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?**\n",
        "The Poisson distribution models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, assuming events occur independently and at a constant average rate.\n",
        "Used in fields like call center traffic, radioactive decay, or number of emails per hour.\n",
        "\n",
        "**10. What is a continuous uniform distribution?**\n",
        "A distribution where all values within an interval are equally likely. For example, the probability of any point between 0 and 1 in a uniform distribution is the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "**11. What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Bell-shaped and symmetric about the mean.\n",
        "* Mean = Median = Mode.\n",
        "* Defined by two parameters: mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).\n",
        "* Empirical rule: \\~68% within 1σ, 95% within 2σ, 99.7% within 3σ.\n",
        "\n",
        "**12. What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?**\n",
        "It’s a special case of the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n",
        "Important because any normal distribution can be converted to the standard normal using Z-scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "**13. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical in statistics?**\n",
        "The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population’s distribution.\n",
        "This makes it possible to use normal distribution techniques for inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "**14. How does the Central Limit Theorem relate to the normal distribution?**\n",
        "It explains why normal distribution appears so often: averages of many samples tend to be normally distributed, even if the data isn’t.\n",
        "\n",
        "**15. What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?**\n",
        "Z statistics are used to determine how many standard deviations a sample statistic is from the population parameter. It helps assess the significance of results in hypothesis testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**16. How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?**\n",
        "**Z = (X - μ) / σ**, where X is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n",
        "It represents how far a value is from the mean in terms of standard deviations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**17. What are point estimates and interval estimates in statistics?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Point estimate**: A single value estimate of a population parameter (e.g., sample mean).\n",
        "* **Interval estimate**: A range within which the parameter is expected to lie (e.g., confidence interval).\n",
        "\n",
        "**18. What is the significance of confidence intervals in statistical analysis?**\n",
        "They give a range of values likely to contain the true population parameter. A 95% confidence interval means we’re 95% confident the interval contains the parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "**19. What is the relationship between a Z-score and a confidence interval?**\n",
        "Z-scores define the critical values that determine the range of a confidence interval in standard normal distributions. For example, ±1.96 Z-scores cover 95% of the distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "**20. How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?**\n",
        "By converting values from different distributions to Z-scores, we standardize them, allowing for direct comparison regardless of original scales.\n",
        "\n",
        "**21. What are the assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* The samples are independent.\n",
        "* The sample size is sufficiently large (typically n ≥ 30).\n",
        "* The population has a finite variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**22. What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution?**\n",
        "The expected value (mean) is the long-run average outcome. It's calculated as the sum of all possible values each multiplied by its probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**23. How does a probability distribution relate to the expected outcome of a random variable?**\n",
        "The distribution provides the probabilities of outcomes, and the expected value is the weighted average of those outcomes, showing the typical result over many trials.\n",
