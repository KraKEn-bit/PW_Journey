        "   Statistics is the study of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It's important for making informed decisions based on data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What are the two main types of statistics?\n",
        "   Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What are descriptive statistics?**\n",
        "   Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the features of a dataset (e.g., mean, median, mode).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is inferential statistics?\n",
        "   Inferential statistics use a sample to make predictions or generalizations about a population.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is sampling in statistics?\n",
        "   Sampling is selecting a subset of individuals from a population to estimate characteristics of the whole group.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What are the different types of sampling methods?\n",
        "   Random, stratified, systematic, cluster, and convenience sampling.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between random and non-random sampling?\n",
        "   Random sampling gives every individual an equal chance; non-random sampling does not.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.Define and give examples of qualitative and quantitative data.\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Qualitative: Categorical data (e.g., colors, names).\n",
        "   * Quantitative: Numerical data (e.g., height, weight).\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What are the different types of data in statistics?\n",
        "   Nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Explain nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio levels of measurement.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Nominal: Categories (e.g., gender).\n",
        "* Ordinal: Order matters (e.g., ranks).\n",
        "* Interval: Equal spacing, no true zero (e.g., temperature).\n",
        "* Ratio: Has a true zero (e.g., age, height).\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the measure of central tendency?\n",
        "    It indicates the center or average of a dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Define mean, median, and mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Mean: Average of values.\n",

        "\n",
        "13.What is the significance of the measure of central tendency?\n",
        "    It helps understand the typical value in a dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is variance, and how is it calculated?\n",
        "    Variance measures data spread; it's the average of squared differences from the mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is standard deviation, and why is it important?\n",
        "    Standard deviation is the square root of variance; it shows how spread out the data is.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. Define and explain the term range in statistics.\n",
        "    Range is the difference between the highest and lowest values.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between variance and standard deviation?\n",
        "    Variance is squared units; standard deviation is in original units\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is skewness in a dataset?\n",
        "    Skewness measures the asymmetry of the data distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What does it mean if a dataset is positively or negatively skewed?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Positively skewed: Tail on the right.\n",
        "* Negatively skewed: Tail on the left.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Define and explain kurtosis.\n",
        "    Kurtosis measures the \"tailedness\" of the distribution (sharpness of peak).\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the purpose of covariance?\n",
        "    Covariance shows how two variables change together.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What does correlation measure in statistics?\n",
        "    Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What is the difference between covariance and correlation?\n",
        "    Covariance is unstandardized; correlation is standardized (ranges from -1 to 1).\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What are some real-world applications of statistics?\n",
        "    Medicine, economics, education, business, government policies, sports analytics, and more.\n"
